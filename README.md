# Community-Queue

Ever have the issue where only 1 person is on aux and you want to queue a song, so have to go over to them and ask them to a queue a song for you, take their phone, and then put in the song and give it back (like an animal)?
Well we live in the 21st century and shouldn't have to deal with all that human interaction and annoyance.
To solve this issue, we are aiming to make a Community Queue for Spotify!
